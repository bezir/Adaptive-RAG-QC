Wikipedia Title: Australian Saloon Car Series
The Australian Super Six Touring Car Series, known originally as the Australian Saloon Car Series, is an Australian motor racing series for drivers of Group 3K Saloon Cars. The Saloon Car category was devised as a low cost amateur sedan racing formula which would potentially replace the ageing HQ Holden category. The original regulations were focused around large Australian sedans of early 1990s vintage with eligibility limited to VN and VP series Holden Commodores and the EA and EB series Ford Falcons. The regulations limited the cars to six cylinder versions rather than the V8 engined models, as the latter might make the category too similar to Commodore Cup. The cars are slightly modified from their road going versions, with an emphasis on safety for racing.
